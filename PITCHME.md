@snapend

**PSD2  introduced 2 new types of regulated service providers:**

* Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs)
* Account Information Service Providers (AISPs)

PISPs and AISPs are classified as Third Party Providers (TPPs)

---

### AISP

A service made available to users of payment services with online access 
to accounts through which the payer can get, thanks to an online platform, 
a consolidated view on their data even those held in multiple banks or payment accounts.

---

### PISP
A service provided where a payer can make an online payment through the service, 
like a direct debit, to a third party beneficiary.

---

## What can PISPs and AISPs do?

A PISP can provide a service to initiate a payment order (payment information) 
from one payment provider, at the request of a user to a payment account held at 
another payment provider.

---

## What can PISPs and AISPs do?

An AISP offers an online service to provide consolidated information (data) 
on one or more payment accounts held by a user who has one or more accounts at 
one or more payment providers.
